- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified? 
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Experience

After playing around with express and the sqlite3 db from the last lab, it wasn't too hard to build on for the final project.
Everything was pretty simple to get done as it was mostly just modifying sql statements to fit with adding a username
section to the blog to track that, so tweaking the table creation and outputs to accommodate the new table column wasn't oo bad.
Adding update functionality to existing posts also wasn't that difficult to kind of follow the template and add a new
sql statement to do that. The HTML and CSS also were pretty simple and fun to go through, trying to make the posts themselves
look a bit better and all the input sections was pretty fun and I enjoyed making it my own. Overall I was able to get the whole
thing done and I felt pretty prepared from all the work we've done before to do it relatively easily. The only few setbacks
I had was forgetting to change a select statement to display the usernames, which I found pretty quickly so no real difficulties.
